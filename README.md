## üåê Deploy via GitHub Pages

1. Push this project to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Settings > Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Branch:** `main` (or your default branch)
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**.

> Make sure to include a `.nojekyll` file in the root to avoid GitHub Pages ignoring files/folders that start with `_`.

## üõ† Future Ideas

- Tag filtering via YAML or `#tags`
- Bidirectional edge arrows
- Editable graph layout persistence
- Real-time sync with markdown updates
