### **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Test Case Generator** documentation. This project is an intelligent, agent-driven system that generates, validates, and optimizes test cases based on user stories or feature descriptions. The solution is built using Phidata Agents, leveraging Agent Teams to ensure a structured, modular workflow.


### **Purpose**

- To automate the process of generating test cases from user stories.
    
- To ensure test cases are accurate, complete, and optimized.
    
- To provide a scalable and easily extendable architecture using Phidata Agents.

### **Structure**

The documentation is divided into the following sections:

1. **[Flow of Agentic AI](Flow of Agentic AI)**  
    Describes the overall architecture and how the agents are organized into teams.
    
2. **[Agent Workflow](Agent Workflow)**  
    Explains the step-by-step process of how agents generate, validate, and optimize test cases.
    
3. **[Knowledge Base Configuration](Knowledge Base Configuration)**  
    Provides details on configuring the knowledge base for domain-specific validation.
    
4. **[Agent Validation Methods](Agent Validation Methods)**  
    Outlines the strategies for validating the generated test cases.
    
5. **[Example Code Implementation](Example Code Implementation)**  
    Demonstrates how the agents are initialized and used in a code example.
    

### **How to Use This Documentation**

- Start by understanding the **Flow of Agentic AI** to get a high-level view of the architecture.
    
- Move to the **Agent Workflow** section to understand the step-by-step process.
    
- Review **Knowledge Base Configuration** if you plan to use domain-specific validation.
    
- Use **Agent Validation Methods** to ensure your test cases are correct.
    
- Finally, refer to **Example Code Implementation** for a ready-to-use code setup.
